# === Notes ===
# 1. If LINE_REDIRECT_URI is blank, backend will attempt to derive using PUBLIC_BASE_URL + /auth/line/callback
# 2. After setting LINE variables, restart backend.
# 3. Set COOKIE_SECURE=1 only when serving over HTTPS.
# 4. AUTH_JWT_SECRET and COOKIE_SECRET must be rotated if leaked.
# 5. Turnstile: provide both VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY (public) and TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY (private) to enable grid creation challenge.
